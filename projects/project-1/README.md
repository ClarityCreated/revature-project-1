# Bank - Money Transfer System

## project description

  My project was to create a reactive website where users would be able to select accounts to 'transfer' money to and from. It was required to have a 'transfer statement' module, where I should display different views for recent and previous transactions.

  ## technologies used
  * Java (IntlliJ IDEA)
  * JavaScript (Visual Studio Code)
  * MySQL database

  #### frontend development
  I chose to use the development tool *webpack*, it made compiling my project effortless. For styling I used *bootstrap*, it was challenging for me to learn but improved my ability to style pages with ease. 

  ####  backend development 
  I relied on multiple dependencies that ultimately increased how quickly I was able to write my code. My *pom.xml* file displays what exact dependencies I used. 

## challenges 

  The amount of time I had to complete this project was hindering. Unfortunately, it took me a long time to figure out how to use bootstrap proficiently. I was learning new frameworks that are going to be more benifical and primarily what I am going to use. I spent too much time figuring out how to make my website easy to navigate and styled, and I was not able to make my website reactive. I hope to have enough time in the future to make my website reactive. 

## how to install and run the project

  ### frontend

  Open your terminal and cd into project-1-front
  ```
  npm i
  npm start
  ```
  The website can be found at http://localhost:3000/

  ### backend

  Open your IDE 
  Find the path to revature-repository/projects/project-1/project-1-back/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
  in the persistence.xml file you are able to connect to MySQL and store information into your database. 
  Once you are connected to your data base run the application.
